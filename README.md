# ðŸ¦€ Rust Projects Playground

A growing collection of Rust mini-projects and code experiments Iâ€™m building as I sharpen my skills and explore the language in depth. Most exercises are inspired by topics in the Brown CS online edition of *The Rust Programming Language* (<https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/>).
